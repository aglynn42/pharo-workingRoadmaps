Here is a draft analysis of the possible actions to be done to continue the work on the integration of OSWindow into Pharo. These notes were taken during a discussion between S. Ducasse, I. Stasenko and E. Lorenzano. They can be wrong and should not be taken as granted. 

Previous to OSWindow
--------------------------------------------------------
Currently the events are fetched via HandMorph>>processEvents

```
HandMorph>>processEvents was handling events
	from Sensor which takes them inputEventSensor
```

In OSWindow handleEvent: anEvent
-------------------------------------------------------------------


OSWindowMorphicEventHandler>>dispatchMorphicEvent: is recreating the morphic events from the OSWindow events.

--------------------------
Right now we are in migration period.

We should move the logic of the InputEventFetcher to the OSVMWindowDriver (represents the old system
within the OSWindow frameworks). This is in the sense that it would be good to avoid to have two different mechanisms. 

The OSWindowMorphicEventHandler>>dispatchMorphicEvent: anEvent 	should be cleaned.


```OSWindowMorphicEventHandler>>dispatchMorphicEvent: anEvent 
```	morphicWorld defer: [ morphicWorld activeHand handleEvent: anEvent ]. 

This method should rewritten with a more efficient approach. We should remove the use of defer:
The OSWindowMorphicEventHandler should act similar to the input Event Fetcher process
by queueing the incoming events so that later will be processed by the UI process (via the hand)
The hand or similar object should fetch events. 

We should pay attention that when then there is no UI process we should not explode. 
Probably the UI Process should be responsible to set the fetching process.


VMDriver should use
* input semaphore
* fetch event
* convert of to OSWindowEvent	
* dispatch to the window's handler

The three first steps are in Sensor logic.

We should rewrite the HandMorph to act as a windowHandler


------------------------------
WorldMorph>>recreateOSWindow, WorldMorph>>pickMostSuitableWindowDriver, WorldMorph>>checkSession
should be packaged with OSWindow
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
OSSDL2Driver>>processEvent: sdlEvent
	| event |
	event := self convertEvent: sdlEvent.
	event ifNotNil: [ eventQueue nextPut: event ].
```

OSSDL2Driver>>processEvent: sdlEvent should not have a queue, or the queue in the window.
It should call a OSWindow.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the logic should be

World
	startUp
		createWindow
			setup event processing. The event handler should be the responsibility of OSSystemWindow.

Each OSWindow has the event handler as shown below.

```		
recreateOSWindow
	| attributes driver |
	session := Smalltalk session.
	attributes := OSWindowAttributes new.
	attributes extent: self extent;
		title: Smalltalk shortImageName;
		icon: Smalltalk ui icons pharoIcon.
		
	driver := self pickMostSuitableWindowDriver.
	attributes preferableDriver: driver.
	osWindow := OSWindow createWithAttributes: attributes.
	osWindow newFormRenderer: Display.
	osWindow eventHandler: (OSWindowMorphicEventHandler for: self).		
```

The Driver knows how to create the window. But it does not know when. 
The client sets up the handler. We can have custom handler for any window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# After the migration period

The Window driver should be responsible to deliver event to consumer similarly 

```
OSSDL2Driver>>eventLoopProcessWithPlugin
	| event session semaIndex |
	event := SDL_Event new.
	session := Smalltalk session.
	semaIndex := (Smalltalk registerExternalObject: inputSemaphore).
	self primSetupInputSemaphore: semaIndex.
	[
		[ inputSemaphore wait; consumeAllSignals. session  == Smalltalk session] whileTrue: [
			[ (SDL2 pollEvent: event) > 0 ] whileTrue: [
				self processEvent: event
			].
		]
	] ensure:  [ Smalltalk unregisterExternalObject: inputSemaphore ]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can clean and remove all the calling tree calling dispatchMorphicEvent: 

We should probably remove OSSDL2Driver>>eventLoopProcessWithoutPlugin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bypassing BitBlt

We should take advantage about the presence of SDL to bypass the bitblt logic for the rendering.

# Windows integration/further work on SDL

- test SDL2 VM support on windows
- isolate the legacy VM code and prepare it to for cleaning
- review the event processing on image side in order to make it more efficient
	- make sure, that UI process setting up the event handling using OSWindow driver
- multiple window support
	- refactor the event handling mechanism to make sure multiple windows can receive events independently
- support for direct rendering. Introduce support for direct rendering to SDL surface using Athens.
	- There is a super small prototype. Do it right!
